# STCLang: A library for implicit, monadic dataflow parallelism




Currently, the `DD` version does not work with the development setup (GHC 8.2.2)
 of the project. This is due to problems with type resolution. It is therefore
 necessary to change the GHC version if the streams-based version is used in
 other code!
